~~ Like UDP, the wind carries information, but sometimes it gets lost.

Simple, message based, allocation free MMO Scale UDP networking in C#. And without wind magic.
<br>Designed for an Epitech project (UDP required)

Sylph was designed with the [KISS Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) in mind.
<br>Sylph is fast and extremely reliable, designed for MMO scale Networking.
<br>Sylph uses framing, so anything sent will be received the same way.
<br>Sylph is raw C++ and can be used in KapEngine too.
<br>Thanks to the based version [Github](https://github.com/vis2k/Telepathy)

## What makes Sylph special?

- Concurrent: Telepathy uses one thread per connection. It can make heavy use of multi core processors.
- Simple: Telepathy wraps all the insanity behind Connect/Send/Disconnect/Tick.
